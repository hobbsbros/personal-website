<p>During my sophomore year of college, the Wordle game became quite a sensation.  I had never heard of it before, and suddenly, all of my friends were playing it.
<p>After a while, I decided I'd check out what the excitement was about.  After playing a few days, I saw the value in the game... it was very simple and yet very stimulating.
<p>I was taking MIT's Fundamentals of Programming (known then as 6.009 or "six double oh nine" to my peers) at the time, and I had just wanted an amazing video by 3Blue1Brown about the information theory behind Wordle.  I decided that, given my newfound knowledge of information and programming, it was time for me to develop a bot that could solve Wordle as effectively as possible.  During my week of spring break, I took a few hours and put together a simple program, and EZWordle was born.
