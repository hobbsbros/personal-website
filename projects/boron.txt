~ When I was about twelve years old, I saw in Barnes & Noble a book about how to code.  Fascinated, I asked my mother if we could buy it.  Knowing my interest in all things technical, my mother permitted me.  Opening the book, I learned about the Python programming language and some of its basic features.

~ I read through the exercises contained in the book and quickly taught myself Python.  Little did I know that I would be using it in my college computer science class just a few years later.

~ From the beginning, I was fascinated by Python's elegant, simple, and readable syntax.  I always wondered if it was possible for me to develop my own computer language... but as a young boy I had no idea the great effort involved in developing and maintaining a programming language.

~ Six years later, after much Internet research and time spent at my laptop, I successfully developed my first programming language: Boron.
