~ When I was about twelve years old, I saw in Barnes & Noble a book about how to code.  Fascinated, I asked my mother if we could buy it.  Knowing my interest in all things technical, my mother permitted me.  Opening the book, I learned about the Python programming language and some of its basic features.

~ I read through the exercises contained in the book and quickly taught myself Python.  Little did I know that I would be using it in my college computer science class just a few years later.

~ From the beginning, I was fascinated by Python's elegant, simple, and readable syntax.  I always wondered if it was possible for me to develop my own computer language... but as a young boy I had no idea the great effort involved in developing and maintaining a programming language.

~ Six years later, after much Internet research and time spent at my laptop, I successfully developed my first programming language: Boron.

# Design Philosophy

~ Boron was designed to be easy to read and fast.  Furthermore, I was not and am not very knowledgeable about low-level compiler functionality, and I didn't want to embark on the journey of using LLVM or another compiler toolkit.

~ Based on my working knowledge of C, I designed the Boron compiler to output raw C that would then be compiled a second time by \it{GCC} or another C language compiler.

# Example

~ The following represents a very simple Boron program.

\code{text}{/code/test-boron.brn}

~ This compiles to the following C code.

\code{c}{/code/test-boron.c}

~ The reader notes a few things here... firstly, the Boron compiler automatically imports two commonly used C header files (\it{stdio} and \it{stdbool}), and secondly, it segregates struct and function definitions.

~ This second feature was included to ensure that structs did not have to be defined before functions.

# Planned Improvements

~ My academic work and extracurricular obligations keep me pretty busy, so the Boron language is not currently under active development and no improvements are planned in the near future.

# Source Code

~ The Boron compiler is completely open-source and licensed under the MIT License.  Its source code is available on GitHub.
