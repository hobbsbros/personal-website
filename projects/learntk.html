<p>Since my high school years, I always had a fascination for machine learning, though I was never very good at it.
<p>Right before I started my freshman year of college and after years of attempts, I successfully developed my very first neural network from scratch.  It was agonizingly slow.  Training on an extremely simple dataset took several seconds or even minutes as opposed to milliseconds.
<p>The problem was that I refused to use NumPy and I didn't know any other programming languages besides Python, so I was stuck implementing every mathematical operation in pure Python, which slowed down my calculations by orders of magnitude.
<p>After my freshman year of college, I took an interest in the Rust programming language, and after learning it sufficiently, I had the skills necessary to try again.  Rust is far faster than Python and almost as fast as C++ by most metrics, so I was confident that I could develop a simple neural network model to train reasonably fast.
<p>After reading my old code for inspiration and guidance, as well as a bit of head-scratching and debugging, the Machine Learning Tool Kit (LearnTK) became a reality.<h2>Structure</h2><h2>Speed</h2><h2>Source Code</h2>
