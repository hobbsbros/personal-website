<p>When I was about twelve years old, I saw in Barnes & Noble a book about how to code.  Fascinated, I asked my mother if we could buy it.  Knowing my interest in all things technical, my mother permitted me.  Opening the book, I learned about the Python programming language and some of its basic features.
<p>I read through the exercises contained in the book and quickly taught myself Python.  Little did I know that I would be using it in my college computer science class just a few years later.
<p>From the beginning, I was fascinated by Python's elegant, simple, and readable syntax.  I always wondered if it was possible for me to develop my own computer language... but as a young boy I had no idea the great effort involved in developing and maintaining a programming language.
<p>Six years later, after much Internet research and time spent at my laptop, I successfully developed my first programming language: Boron.<h2>Design Philosophy</h2>
<p>Boron was designed to be easy to read and fast.  Furthermore, I was not and am not very knowledgeable about low-level compiler functionality, and I didn't want to embark on the journey of using LLVM or another compiler toolkit.
<p>Based on my working knowledge of C, I designed the Boron compiler to output raw C that would then be compiled a second time by <em>GCC</em> or another C language compiler.<h2>Example</h2>
<p>The following represents a very simple Boron program.<pre><code class="language-text">main -> int {
    let int x: 3
}</code></pre>
<p>This compiles to the following C code.<pre><code class="language-c">// Executable autogenerated by the Boron compiler
// Version 0.25.1
// Created on 2022/07/24 at 13:00:59 local time

#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdbool.h&gt;


// Structs begin here

// Functions begin here
int main() {
int x = 3;
}</code></pre>
<p>The reader notes a few things here... firstly, the Boron compiler automatically imports two commonly used C header files ( <em>stdio</em> and <em>stdbool</em> ), and secondly, it segregates struct and function definitions.
<p>This second feature was included to ensure that structs did not have to be defined before functions.<h2>Planned Improvements</h2>
<p>My academic work and extracurricular obligations keep me pretty busy, so the Boron language is not currently under active development and no improvements are planned in the near future.<h2>Source Code</h2>
<p>The Boron compiler is completely open-source and licensed under the MIT License.  Its source code is available on GitHub.
