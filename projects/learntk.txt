~ Since my high school years, I always had a fascination for machine learning, though I was never very good at it.

~ Right before I started my freshman year of college and after years of attempts, I successfully developed my very first neural network from scratch.  It was agonizingly slow.  Training on an extremely simple dataset took several seconds or even minutes as opposed to milliseconds.

~ The problem was that I refused to use NumPy and I didn't know any other programming languages besides Python, so I was stuck implementing every mathematical operation in pure Python, which slowed down my calculations by orders of magnitude.

~ After my freshman year of college, I took an interest in the Rust programming language, and after learning it sufficiently, I had the skills necessary to try again.  Rust is far faster than Python and almost as fast as C++ by most metrics, so I was confident that I could develop a simple neural network model to train reasonably fast.

~ After reading my old code for inspiration and guidance, as well as a bit of head-scratching and debugging, the Machine Learning Tool Kit (LearnTK) became a reality.

# Capability

~ LearnTK is itself very simple and therefore cannot compete with intelligently crafted or large-scale artificial intelligence programs.  However, it can still hold its own in simple situations.

~ Using a neural network of three hidden layers and a learning rate of 0.03, I trained LearnTK on the \href{IRIS dataset}{https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/53/iris}, a very simple dataset consisting of information about three subspecies of \it{Iris} flowers.  The following plot shows mean training cost per epoch for 1,000 epochs.
