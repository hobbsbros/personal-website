<h2>About Me</h2>

 <img src="/media/me.jpg" class="floating" alt="Joseph having breakfast"> 

<p>Hello!  My name is Joseph Hobbs and I am a rising senior undergraduate at MIT (class of 2025) studying Aerospace Engineering (known among MIT students as Course 16).
<p>Academically, I have special interest in electrical and electronics engineering, structural mechanics, aerodynamics, numerical simulation, and software development.  I also enjoy designing things in Fusion 360 and programming in Python 3 or Rust.
<p>I'm a cadet in the Army ROTC and plan to commission into the U.S. Army Reserves in May 2025.  Looking ahead to the future, I hope to work for a civilian engineering firm full-time while fulfilling my service obligation to the U.S. Army Reserves as a Cyber officer.
<p>Outside of school, I enjoy spending time with the people in my life I care about most.  I also enjoy running, playing the piano and guitar, and volunteering with my Catholic community.
<p>Please check out my website and learn more about the things I've worked on!<h2>Credits</h2><h3>Fonts</h3>
