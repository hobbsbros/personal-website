# About Me

\floating{/media/me.jpg}{Joseph having breakfast}

~ Hello!  My name is Joseph Hobbs and I am a rising senior undergraduate at MIT (class of 2025) studying Aerospace Engineering (known among MIT students as Course 16).

~ Academically, I have particular interests in electrical and electronics engineering, structural mechanics, aerodynamics, numerical simulation, software development, and systems engineering.  I also enjoy designing things in Fusion 360 and programming in Python 3 or Rust.

~ I'm a cadet in the Army ROTC and plan to commission into the U.S. Army Reserves in summer 2025.  Looking ahead to the future, I hope to work for a civilian engineering firm full-time while fulfilling my service obligation to the U.S. Army Reserves as a Cyber Warfare Officer.

~ Outside of school, I enjoy spending time with the people in my life I love and care about most.  I also enjoy running, playing the piano and guitar, and volunteering with my Catholic community.

~ Please check out my website and learn more about the things I've worked on!
