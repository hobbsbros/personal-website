# Academic Projects

~ Here are some interesting engineering and design projects I've worked on in school that I found fascinating.

# Work Projects

~ I've worked on a number of projects while under employment... the ones below are the open-source ones that I'm able to share.

# Independent Projects

~ These are some of my favorite independent projects.

    \tiledesc{Boron}{Compiled programming language}{/media/code.jpg}{/projects/independent/boron}
    \tiledesc{Blog Builder}{Static web framework}{/media/code.jpg}{/projects/independent/blog-builder}
    \tiledesc{RSVLM}{Inviscid aerodynamic model}{/media/vlm-wing.jpg}{/projects/independent/rsvlm}
    \tiledesc{LearnTK}{Neural network}{/media/learntk.jpg}{/projects/independent/learntk}
}

# Interest Items

~ I never developed each of these sufficiently to the point that they deserve to be called a project.  However, I still learned valuable tools studying these, so I'm considering them "interest items" and I've given them a separate category.
